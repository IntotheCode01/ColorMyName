# [ColorMyName]

This little function is made to help everyone get familiar with color names of CSS,
it's much easier to remember a cool name than a hex code.

Feel free to pull and submit your own colors with an intuitive name.

## Quick start

** Initiate the class.

 -> var colorNames = new ColorNames({
                "numOfShades":10
            });

** And get what you like.
 -> var _colorNames = colorNames.returnItems('all_names');
 -> var _colorValues = colorNames.returnItems('all_indexed_obj');	

** Options include:

-> "all", "all_names", "all_indexed_obj", "shades"
